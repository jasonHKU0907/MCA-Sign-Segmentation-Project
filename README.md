# Automated segmentation of the hyperdense MCA sign of acute ischemic stroke on non-contrast CT images

The Project for automated segmentation of the hyperdense MCA sign on non-contrast CT images. 
In order to geometrically align all CT brains, we launched a data-preprocessing procedure.

1st Obtrain a CT template where averaging all brain CTs.

2nd Skull stripping

3rd Brain registration

The data pre-processing steps are now uploaded. Models and weights will be shared later upon the publication of our research.
